# Voice Recogniton API


Voice Recognition API with JavaScript.

Voice or speaker recognition is the ability of a machine or program to receive and interpret dictation or to understand and carry out spoken commands.

In this project JavaScript has access to a  browserâ€™s audio stream and to convert it to text. The idea is to illustrate how the Voice Recognition API works, so don't get offended by the answers and don't put your expectations high.

It is a good idea to implement this API in your website in case you are looking for a voice command to navigate in your website.
